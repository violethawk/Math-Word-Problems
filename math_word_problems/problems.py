-------------

This module defines the word problem set for Phase 1 of the Math Word Problems
project.  Fifty problems are organised across five difficulty tiers.  Each
problem is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

``problem`` (str):
    The text of the word problem presented to the agent.

``expected_answer`` (float):
    The numeric answer expected for the problem.  Answers are provided
    as floating‑point values and may include fractional components.

``tier`` (int):
    The difficulty tier (1–5) indicating the number of arithmetic
    operations required to solve the problem.

Problems in the higher tiers often involve multiple chained operations,
such as multiplication followed by addition or division.  All arithmetic
has been thoroughly verified; if you modify or extend the problem set,
please double‑check the calculations to avoid false failures during
benchmarking.

The ``PROBLEMS`` list preserves the order of the problems.  A lookup
dictionary ``PROBLEM_BY_TEXT`` provides constant‑time access by problem
string.
