# Math Word Problems — Single-Agent Introduction

## The canonical introduction to single-agent LLM systems

An agent that can't do math. A calculator it can call. Word problems it has to solve.

The simplest possible demonstration of the think-act-observe loop: the agent reads a word problem, reasons about which operations to perform, calls a calculator tool, observes the result, and chains operations together until it reaches the answer.

Built with LangGraph and Claude.

## Why This Exists

`print("Hello, World!")` teaches you that your compiler works.

Math Word Problems teaches you that your agent works — that it can reason about a task, select a tool, execute an action, observe the result, and decide what to do next. The math is trivial. The pattern is the point.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/violethawk/math-word-problems.git
cd math-word-problems
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Solve a problem with the LLM agent
python -m math_word_problems --llm "I have 3 baskets with 12 apples each. I eat 7. How many are left?"

# Solve with step-by-step trace
python -m math_word_problems --llm --verbose "I have 3 baskets with 12 apples each. I eat 7. How many are left?"

# Use Phase 2 tools (unit converter, percentage calculator, date calculator)
python -m math_word_problems --llm --phase 2 "A recipe calls for 2.5 cups of flour for 4 servings. How many grams for 8 servings?"

# Use Phase 3 (detects unsolvable problems)
python -m math_word_problems --llm --phase 3 "A car drives from A to B in 3 hours. How fast was it going?"

# Run the predefined solver (no API key needed)
python -m math_word_problems --benchmark

# Run LLM benchmarks
python -m math_word_problems --llm --benchmark --phase 1
python -m math_word_problems --llm --benchmark --phase 2
python -m math_word_problems --llm --benchmark --phase 3
```

## Sample Output

```
Problem: I have 3 baskets with 12 apples each. I eat 7. How many are left?

Step 1 -- THINK: I need to find the total number of apples first. Multiply 3 baskets by 12 apples.
Step 2 -- ACT:   calculator({'operation': 'multiply', 'a': 3, 'b': 12})
Step 3 -- OBSERVE: 36.0
Step 4 -- THINK: Now I subtract the 7 apples that were eaten.
Step 5 -- ACT:   calculator({'operation': 'subtract', 'a': 36, 'b': 7})
Step 6 -- OBSERVE: 29.0
Step 7 -- THINK: FINAL ANSWER: 29

Answer: 29
Correct: + (expected: 29.0)
```

## The Full Problem Set

All 130 questions and answers are documented in **[QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md)** — every problem, its expected answer, and a fully worked example for each tier showing the complete think-act-observe trace.

---

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1 — One Tool, Clear Problems

The agent has one tool: a basic calculator with four operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Problems have unambiguous answers and require 1-5 operations chained together.

The agent cannot do math in its head. It must use the calculator for every arithmetic operation — even obvious ones. This constraint is enforced by the system prompt and validated by checking that every numeric result in the answer trace came from a tool call, not from the LLM's own output.

**Key concepts:** Think-act-observe loop, tool calling, chain-of-thought reasoning.

**Benchmark:** 50 word problems across 5 difficulty tiers (1-operation through 5-operation). Measure: accuracy, tool calls per problem, total tokens, cost.

### Phase 2 — Multiple Tools, Ambiguous Problems

Add tools: unit converter (miles↔km, lbs↔kg, °F↔°C), percentage calculator, date/time calculator. Problems don't specify which tool to use — the agent must decide.

"A recipe serves 4 and needs 2.5 cups of flour. I'm cooking for 7 people and I only have a kitchen scale. How many grams of flour do I need?"

The agent has to: scale the recipe (multiply), then convert cups to grams (unit converter). Tool selection, not just tool use.

**Key concepts:** Tool selection, multi-tool chaining, implicit requirements.

**Benchmark:** 30 problems requiring 2-3 different tools. Measure: accuracy, correct tool selection rate, unnecessary tool calls.

### Phase 3 — Incomplete Information and Failure

Problems that can't be solved with the available information. The agent must recognize the gap and say so rather than hallucinate an answer.

"Two trains leave cities 400 miles apart, heading toward each other. Train A goes 60 mph. When do they meet?"

Train B's speed is missing. The correct answer is "I can't solve this — Train B's speed isn't given." The agent should ask for the missing information rather than guess.

Also: problems with trick questions, irrelevant information included as distractors, and problems where the arithmetic is simple but the reasoning about what to compute is hard.

**Key concepts:** Knowing when you can't solve something, asking clarifying questions, filtering irrelevant information, reasoning vs. computing.

**Benchmark:** 20 solvable problems mixed with 10 unsolvable ones. Measure: accuracy on solvable, correct rejection rate on unsolvable, hallucination rate.

### Robustness Extension — Tiers 9 & 10

Tiers 1–8 teach the canonical single-agent loop. Tiers 9–10 test robustness under ambiguity, partial information, and messy real-world phrasing.

**Tier 9 — Advanced Reasoning Under Ambiguity (10 problems)**

Problems where the agent must solve the solvable part of a partially-specified problem, choose between competing interpretations ("does a lap mean one length or out-and-back?"), state assumptions, and resist irrelevant numbers.

**Tier 10 — Adversarial and Real-World Inputs (10 problems)**

Real human input: "ok so i bought like 4 boxes of granola bars, 12 in each, gave 7 away, how many left." Approximate language ("about 210 miles", "roughly 30 mpg"), redundant numbers (street addresses, years, elevations), multi-sentence clutter, and scenarios requiring non-obvious tool combinations.

**Key concepts:** Partial solvability, assumption-stating, interpretation selection, noise tolerance, robustness.

**Benchmark:** 20 problems across tiers 9-10. Measure: accuracy under ambiguity, correct handling of messy inputs.

## Architecture

```
User (word problem)
  → Agent (Claude Haiku — cheap, fast, sufficient for math reasoning)
    → THINK: decompose the problem
    → ACT: call calculator/converter tool
    → OBSERVE: receive result
    → THINK: what's next?
    → [repeat until solved]
  → Answer + full reasoning trace
```

The agent is a LangGraph state machine with two nodes — an `agent` node (calls Claude) and a `tool_node` (executes tool calls) — connected by a conditional edge that loops until the model stops requesting tools. State tracks the conversation history, tool call results, and the agent's reasoning chain.

```python
{
    "problem": str,                    # the word problem text
    "steps": [
        {
            "type": "think" | "act" | "observe",
            "content": str,            # reasoning text or tool result
            "tool": str | None,        # tool name if type == "act"
            "args": dict | None,       # tool arguments if type == "act"
            "result": Any | None       # numeric result if type == "observe"
        }
    ],
    "answer": str | None,              # final answer
    "answer_numeric": float | None,    # extracted numeric answer for verification
    "status": "solving" | "solved" | "unsolvable",
    "tool_calls": int,
    "tokens_in": int,
    "tokens_out": int
}
```

## Tools

### calculator

```python
@tool
def calculator(operation: str, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic.
    
    Args:
        operation: one of "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"
        a: first number
        b: second number
    
    Returns:
        Result of the operation.
    """
```

Four operations. That's it. No exponents, no roots, no trig. If the agent needs something fancier, it has to compose from these primitives (e.g., squaring is `multiply(x, x)`). This constraint is deliberate — it forces multi-step reasoning.

### unit_converter (Phase 2)

```python
@tool
def unit_converter(value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> float:
    """
    Converts between common units.
    
    Supported conversions:
        Distance: miles ↔ km, feet ↔ meters, inches ↔ cm
        Weight: lbs ↔ kg, oz ↔ grams, cups ↔ grams (flour/sugar/water)
        Temperature: fahrenheit ↔ celsius
    """
```

### percentage_calculator (Phase 2)

```python
@tool
def percentage_calculator(operation: str, base: float, percent: float) -> float:
    """
    Percentage operations.
    
    Args:
        operation: "of" (what is X% of Y), "change" (Y changed by X%), 
                   "what_percent" (X is what % of Y)
        base: the base number
        percent: the percentage value
    """
```

### date_calculator (Phase 2)

```python
@tool
def date_calculator(operation: str, date: str, days: int = 0) -> str:
    """
    Date arithmetic.
    
    Args:
        operation: "add_days", "subtract_days", "days_between", "day_of_week"
        date: date string in YYYY-MM-DD format
        days: number of days (for add/subtract operations)
    """
```

"A store has 4 shelves with 15 books each. They sell 12 and receive a shipment of 20. How many now?"
"You earn $12/hour for 8 hours, then $18/hour for 3 hours overtime. What's your total pay?"

**Tier 4 — Four operations (10 problems)**

### Benchmark Results (Claude Haiku 4.5)

#### Phase 1 — Calculator Only

```
| Tier | Problems | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Tool Calls | Avg Tokens In | Avg Tokens Out |
|------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            1.0 |          1654 |            134 |
| 2    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            2.0 |          2292 |            268 |
| 3    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            3.0 |          2844 |            365 |
| 4    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            3.6 |          4166 |            460 |
| 5    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            5.1 |          6361 |            632 |
| ALL  | 50       | 50      |     100% |                |               |                |
```

Perfect accuracy across all tiers. Token usage scales linearly with problem complexity.

#### Phase 2 — Multiple Tools

```
| Tier | Problems | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Tool Calls | Avg Tokens In | Avg Tokens Out |
|------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 6    | 30       | 30      |     100% |            2.7 |          5280 |            375 |
```

The agent correctly selects between calculator, unit converter, percentage calculator, and date calculator across all 30 problems.

#### Phase 3 — Incomplete Information & Robustness

```
| Tier | Problems | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Tool Calls | Avg Tokens In | Avg Tokens Out |
|------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 7    | 20       | 20      |     100% |            2.3 |          4667 |            307 |
| 8    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            0.0 |          1498 |            164 |
| 9    | 10       | 10      |     100% |            1.9 |          4705 |            278 |
| 10   | 10       | 10      |     100% |            2.3 |          4917 |            309 |
| ALL  | 50       | 50      |     100% |                |               |                |
```

Tier 8 (unsolvable) uses zero tool calls — the agent correctly rejects before computing. Zero hallucinations across all unsolvable problems. All ambiguous, partially-solvable, and messy real-world inputs handled correctly.

#### Overall: 130/130 (100%)

#### The Meta-Benchmark

The LLM agent solves all 50 Phase 1 problems correctly — but so does a Python script with hardcoded operation plans:

```
| Method          | Accuracy | Time      | Cost    |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Agent (Haiku)   | 50/50    | ~320s     | ~$0.02  |
| Python script   | 50/50    | <0.001s   | $0.00   |
```

The agent gets the same answers but is ~300,000x slower and costs money. The point isn't that agents are good at arithmetic. The point is that you now understand how agents work — and you know when not to use one.

## What This Project Teaches

1. **The think-act-observe loop** — the fundamental pattern underlying all LLM agents
2. **Tool calling** — how agents interact with external capabilities
3. **Chain-of-thought reasoning** — how agents decompose complex tasks into steps
4. **Tool selection** — how agents decide which tool to use (Phase 2)
5. **Knowing what you don't know** — how agents handle missing information (Phase 3)
6. **Reasoning under ambiguity** — how agents handle partial information, competing interpretations, and messy inputs (Tiers 9-10)
7. **When not to use an agent** — the meta-benchmark proves a Python script beats the agent on every dimension for this task

## Where This Leads

Math Word Problems is Level 1 of a three-part curriculum for agentic coding:

**Level 1 — Math Word Problems** (this project)
You understand what an agent *is*. One agent, one tool, think-act-observe.

**Level 2 — Maze Solver**
You understand what an agent is *good at*. One agent, spatial reasoning, memory, backtracking. Benchmarked against A* and wall-following.

**Level 3 — 52 Card Pickup**
You understand how agents *work together* — and when they shouldn't. Multiple agents, coordination, conflict resolution, scaling experiments.

Nobody wants to do math homework. Nobody wants to solve a maze. Nobody wants to pick up 52 cards. That's why we build agents.
